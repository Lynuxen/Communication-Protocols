Tema 3

I implemented the homework using the 10th lab as well as the Parson API.

Parson was used for creating payloads as well as printing them in
a more user-friendly way.

I also added the function "compute_delete_request" in requests.c to
implement the delete_book function.

If the request is valid and has succeded, a prompt will inform the user
of it. For example, for "login", if it was succesful, it will print
"Logged in!".  Otherwise, errors will be printed using Parson to avoid
the curly brackets and quotes, i.e. 

"{"error:","Authorization header is missing!"}"

will be printed as

"Error: Authorization..."

get_book and get_books will display information either tabbed or
alligned.
