TEMA 2 PROTOCOALE DE COMUNICATII

When a subscriber requests a connection to the server (i == sock_fd) I
automatically append their ID and check the ID.

Exit codes:

-exit 1: The ID is above 10 characters
-exit 2: The ID is already in use

These are sent back at the subscriber refusing the connection
and stating why. Exit 0 is used for when the server gracefully
exits. If the ID is valid then I check if its an existing
subscriber and update their fields, as well as sending the
messages that they recieved while they were offline. If not, then
they are added to the database.

When (i == sock_fd_udp) it means I receive an UDP message. I parse it,
send it to those that are subscribed and also store it in the database
should they be offline and have the flag set to 1 for that topic.
recvfrom() was used here to get the IP and the port. 

If (i == 0) then the server takes commands. Exit will close all
connections to subscribers, closing them as well, as well as deleting
the database.

The rest is messages from the TCP client. If recv == 0, that means that
the server crashed or, viceversa, the subscriber. If it was the subscriber
then his information is updated to not cause issues down the line.
